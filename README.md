# Repo-15
This repo is for the Projet Saburi-Konnect. 
We have built a system where the non-profits like Saburi Charitable Foundation can enter the details of the children we sponsor. This may include a picture, their personal details, their family background etc will have the ability to attach the receipts of the expenditure. This system is completely secure and is available only for admins and sponsors. Admin access is for the non-profits and they enter the details of the children. Sponsors can have the read access and only can view the details of the sponsored children.
